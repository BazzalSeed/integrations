### DESCRIPTION

SignalFx generates a number of metrics you can use to monitor the status of your organization, including:

-  Ingest-related metrics, such as the number of active and inactive time series or how many datapoints were sent using a backfill API.

-  Org status metrics, such as the number of unique metrics across all metric or event time series or the number of dashboards or charts in the org

-  AWS-related metrics, such as TO BE FILLED IN


### USAGE

For admins, some of these are already used in charts on the Organization Overview page. Can clone any of them to add or replace values in the chart, then save to a custom dashboard you create for this purpose.

Example of using metric x to troubleshoot problem y.
