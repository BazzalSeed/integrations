### CONFIGURATION
By default the CPU plugin will assign each CPU a number and use that as the plugin_instance. This gives a very detailed report of CPU usage, but it is not generally useful. Use the [following configuration](https://github.com/signalfx/Integrations/blob/master/collectd-aggregation/10-aggregation-cpu.conf) to aggregate CPU metrics.
